# [Logistic Regression](https://www.ibm.com/topics/logistic-regression)

In this repository I implement logistic regression from scratch. I utilized sklearn to split the training/test data and find the scores. I also utilized matplotlib to communicate my scores with a confusion matrix, as shown below.


As [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/logistic-regression) puts it, 

*"Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didnâ€™t vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables. Since the outcome is a probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1. This type of statistical model (also known as logit model) is often used for classification and predictive analytics."*

## Data utilized
The data utilized can be found [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/), and the paper that was published along with the data can be found [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0090081#s3).
